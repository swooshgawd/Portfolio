# Portfolio
I used a marble background with some black bolded text for standout purposes. I put a navigation bar at the top of my portfolio to emphasize the headings that I would use throughout the rest of the page. I also used cards from Bootstrap to outline my previous life experiences. I gave each card a title which represented the location, and also a brief summary under each one. At the bottom of my page, I added a contact information section where any viewers could see my phone number, Instagram, Facebook and GitHub accounts. 

Here are images of my working application:
